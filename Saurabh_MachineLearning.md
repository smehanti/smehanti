It is mainly of 2 types.

1.Supervised 
2.Unsupervised

## Supervised Learning 
Includes:

### Regression:
1.Simple Linear Regression.
2.Multiple Linear Regression.
3.Polynomial Linear Regression.
4.Support Vector Regression.
5.Decision Tree.
6.Random Forest.

### Classification:
1.Logistic Regression.
2.K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
3.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4.Kernel SVM
5.Naive Bayes.
6.Decision Tree.
7.Random Forest.

## Unsupervised Learning
Includes:

### Clustering:
1.K-means Clustering.
2.Hierarchical Clustering.
3.Mean Shift.

### Association:
1.Apiori
2.Eclat


##Machine Learning Model Evaluation.
1.Confusion Matrix
2.Accuracy Score
3.Precision
